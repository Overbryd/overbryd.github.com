This week, a colleague approached me with a couple of questions about freelancing.
He asked about the contract I am using, taxes and the usual technical things.

As we were chatting, he revealed his intentions to become a freelancer to better battle the overhours
and pay he was getting from the startup he is working on.

I ended up writing a couple of elaborate answers, here is what I think.

The core to my answers was, that I certainly think that freelancing can give you a good position to negotiate on time and money.
And you have to exercise that position, otherwise you end up in a situation that neither you want,
nor any client can be happy with.

I see this tightly coupled with some of my best strenghts, that I can bring to any project and differentiate
me from others.
The most obvious being, my **very high level of motivation**.

Lets ponder over this a little bit deeper.

The time I have in my life, is my most precious resource. If everything goes well, I think I can do about 80 years.
And I choose to live in a society and contribute to it, so work is naturally something that I want to
spend time with.

So look at your day, your week and see what portion of time is spent working.
I can tell you exactly how much time I have spent working productively, because I meticulously keep track of time.
This is due to the fact, that I work based on an hourly rate.

My time entries are exact down to the minute. In an overview, and I can proudly show you weeks I logged 50+ hours.
I can also show you, with the same pride, weeks with < 15 work hours or less, even over a couple of months.

There are times, I see myself in need, the project can make use of my skills and I am motivated to be working on it.
I will happily contribute my time, skill and motivation.

But I am equally content with times where I can spend most of the day playing with my children, reading books and
doing 'nothing'. 'Nothing productive'.

So, over the course of the years, I became accustomed to this low- and high tide way of working.

There is a strong relation between these intense, fast and long work sessions and doing nothing.
For me, one cannot exist without the other.

I thrive in critical situations, facing challenging problems. And if I can honestly take a challenge,
my whole body and mind are supporting me for the cause.
Over the years, I have learned how much energy I can tap into for my work. And with the right amount of
downtime, this is a hell lot of energy.

People see me doing 14+ hours a day, three times a week, and for the naive bystander it looks
like I am working crazy hard. In reality, I am just very aware of how much of my time I can use for work,
and when I need a break.

**I need a strong position** to negotiate about my own time.
I can not, and will not let a company, client or who-ever I am working with dictate how much time I can spend on
a cause that I trade my time against money.

Here you have one of my main reasons, I choose to be a freelancer over being an employee.

## Conclusion

If you are in a position that someone is 'using' you, or sometimes you could even say 'abusing' you.
Make up your mind, and start deciding for yourself.

* How much of your time are you willing to invest for some other cause than your own?

* How much can you give sustainably, without taking a risk or damaging your health?

* What is really driving your motivation? What do you, expect from yourself at work?
