# Starting fresh

It was about time to restart my blog. There is so much happening right now, many very good things, that ought to be shared.

I have a repository [overbryd.github.io](https://github.com/Overbryd/overbryd.github.io "Overbryd/overbryd.github.io"). Its first commit dates back to Feb 27, 2009. 

I have a number of articles in my pipeline, all waiting to get deployed. Since I started my career, I am now at my 3rd programming language, that I use professionally and have applications running in production.

There is sooo much to tell, and I cannot wait to get started.

First, since I am a hacker by heart, I _have completely reset_ my publication pipeline. And of course, I am going to dissect every bit and piece of it along the way.

Lean back, subscribe, and dive right into my world. I really hope you can enjoy reading my blog.

We are now at \[`master (root-commit) a0d3a2e\] starting fresh`

So much to do, so much to write.
