# Starting fresh

I have a repository
[overbryd.github.io](https://github.com/Overbryd/overbryd.github.io). Its first
commit dates back to Feb 27, 2009.

It was about time to restart my blog. There is so much happening right now,
many very good things, that ought to be shared.

So lean back, get your favorite beverage and dive right into my world.
I really hope you can enjoy reading my blog.

We are now at `[master (root-commit) a0d3a2e] starting fresh`
