It was about time to restart my blog. There are so many great things happening right now.
All want to be shared, dissected and written up.

Now I have completely reset my content pipeline. **New** static site generator. **New** repository layout. **New** template.
<!--more-->

I have a repository [overbryd.github.io](https://github.com/Overbryd/overbryd.github.io "Overbryd/overbryd.github.io"). Its first commit dates back to Feb 27, 2009.

I have a number of articles in my pipeline, all waiting to get deployed. Since I started my career, I am now at my 3rd programming language, that I use professionally and have applications running in production.

First, since I am a hacker by heart, I am going to dissect every bit and piece of my new content pipeline, along the way.

Lean back, subscribe, and dive right into my world. I really hope you can enjoy reading my blog.

We are now at `50a875be3eac870121c72c3e0951d8c8257db1fc Initializing master branch for publication`.

So much to do, so much to write.
