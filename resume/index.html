    <p>I was born on the 21st of May 1987 in Innsbruck. At the moment I live in Berlin, with my beloved wife and two children.</p>
    <p>In this resume you will find out how I do the things I love to do. Those things include software development, co-founding <a href="http://paperc.de" title="Germans tech startup of the year 2009">PaperC</a>, occassional blogging and hacking Ruby code. </p>
    <p>Freelancing is my preferred way to work, but from time to time I engage myself in long term projects. I strive for efficient and simple results, and for those I'm not afraid taking steep paths. I work best in creative but structured environments, alongside <a href="http://co-up.de" title="co.up coworking space Berlin">like minded people</a>.</p>

      <h2>Creativity</h2>
      <p>I love to think in solutions, I love creative new ways, I love to throw ideas around. But in the end, everything that matters to me is a simple yet easy to use product.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Creation</h2>
      <p>I write well tested, maintainable applications. Having lead a tech startup with more than <a href="http://blog.paperc.de/2011/04/feiere-mit-uns-den-100-000-registrierten-nutzer/" title="German blog article about the 100.000th user of PaperC">100k customers</a> thaught me many lessons.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Coordination</h2>
      <p>I do not only speak with computers, I love working together with other people. I'm glad that I've had the chance to be part of <a href="http://upstre.am" title="For example upstream software consultancy">amazing teams</a>. When there is an opportunity to help out, I love to take chance.</p>

      <div><span class="timespan">since 10/2011</span>, <span class="role">Developer</span></div>
      <p>Kreuzwerker is a software consultancy based in Berlin.</p>
      <p>During my time I was involved in maintaining existing applications, planning out the Digital Asset Management system for AIDA cruises and some spicy rescue missions.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://flat.st">Flat.st</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">07/2011</span>, <span class="role">Developer</span></div>
      <p>A short but very enjoyable gig for the web's next flatsharing platform. There I was involved in many discussions about user interaction and I've implemented some vanilla features on a Rails 3 application. I've also introduced RSpec acceptance tests.</p>
    </div>

      <h3><a href="http://euruko2011.org">EuRuKo 2011</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">06/2010 - 05/2011</span>, <span class="role">Organizer</span></div>
      <p>During the EuRuKo event in 2010 the Ruby User Group Berlin intended to take over the conference for 2011. I liked the idea to give the Ruby community something back by helping to make this event happen.</p>
      <p>As a part of the organizatino team I helped creating the InDesign layout for the sponsoring brochure and hosting the website. During the conference, I was busy as everyone else but I also had great fun managing the Twitter communication.</p>
    </div>

      <h3><a href="http://euruko2011.org">Palupas</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">since 06/2010</span>, <span class="role">Consultant</span></div>
      <p>I accidentally met Mathias Eylers, the founder of Palupas GmbH, at a Start-Up dinner in Berlin. I really liked his idea of customizing flip flops for the masses. His idea was to go and sell online, so with my experience I could help him accelerating his online launch. Since then I take care of the servers.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><a href="http://euruko2011.org">Upstream</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">08/2009</span>, <span class="role">Developer</span></div>
      <p>Besides working together with Upstream at the PaperC platform, I was developing features for a client project of them. Unfortunately this project is no longer online, but the code and tests I wrote are still passing.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3><a href="http://paperc.de">PaperC</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">02/2008 - 06/2011</span>, <span class="role">Co-Founder</span></div>
      <p>PaperC was my first Start-Up. There I had the role of the technician and was responsible for planning and building an eBook platform. The idea is to bring textbooks and specialists literature onto the web. During my time at PaperC I worked together with Upstream Berlin. In 2009 the company won the <a href="http://www.deutsche-startups.de/2009/11/30/paperc-ist-das-start-up-des-jahres/">Start Up of the year award</a> given by deutsche-startups.de</p>
      <p>My responsibilites as a Co-Founder went from implementing features to keeping the infrastructure healthy. The team size was varying a lot, since we worked in project teams together with freelancers. At peak the team grew up to 6 people who worked on the platform.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://lrieder.com">lrieder.com Webdesign</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">01/2007 - 08/2009</span>, <span class="role">Freelancer</span></div>
      <p>The project lrieder.com was my first approach to realize web projects as a freelancer. During that time I was responsible for designing, creating and hosting over 17 sites of small to mid sized companies. Not many of the sites survived until today, only some are still in use. I'm very happy about this time, because of the many great client relations.</p>

      <div><span class="timespan">10/2006 - 07/2007</span>, <span class="role">Civil service</span></div>
      <p>My civil service was a very influencal time in my life so far. It was an incredible experience working with disabled children. Those children seem so far away from life on first sight, but they feel, live and enjoy life as much as we do.</p>
