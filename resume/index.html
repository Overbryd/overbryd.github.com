    <img id="photo" src="square.jpg" />
    <p>I was born on the 21st of May 1987 in Innsbruck. Currently I am living in Berlin, being a father of two children. I speak English and German at the level of a native speaker.</p>
    <p>In this resume you will find out how I do the things I love to do. This includes software development, entrepreneurship, giving talks, occassional blogging and hacking Ruby code. </p>
    <p>Freelancing is my preferred style of work, but from time to time I like to engage in long term projects. I strive for efficient and simple results, and for those I do not fear taking steep paths. I work best in creative but structured environments alongside <a href="http://co-up.de" title="co.up coworking space Berlin">like minded people</a>.</p>

      <h2>Creativity</h2>
      <p>I love to think in solutions, I love creative new ways, I love to throw ideas around. But in the end, everything that matters to me is a simple yet easy to use product.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Creation</h2>
      <p>I write well tested, maintainable applications. Having lead a tech startup with more than <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150715131302/http://blog.paperc.com/2011/04/27/feiere-mit-uns-den-100-000-registrierten-nutzer/" title="German blog article about the 100.000th user of PaperC">100k customers</a> thaught me many lessons.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>I do not only speak with computers, but I also love working together with people. I am glad that I have had the chance to be part of some <a href="http://upstre.am" title="For example upstream software consultancy">amazing teams</a>. Whenever there is an opportunity to help out, I love to take on the challenge.</p>

      <p>Simplybuy.it is the simplest checkout platform one can use.</p>
      <p>
        I was always annoyed with shop platforms, so annoyed that I set forth to build my own.
        Simplybuy.it is the simplest approach to a common problem: Checkout a product on the internet. It allows sellers to simply create a link to a checkout page where customers can enter their shipping information.
        The checkout process is the shortest, best optimized checkout process you can find on the internet.

      <p>Opencorporates is the worlds largest open company database.</p>
      <p>
        At Opencorporates I was working on their API and an internal reconciliation service. I have also worked on their flexible ETL pipeline that allows measured reconciliation on vague information.
        This allows their system to ingest and renconcile more data, from more source than they could have done before.

      <p>Wooga is Berlins leading Social gaming company.</p>
      <p>
        During my long time at Wooga I was working in two game teams. Having built fast, robust and maintainable backends, with more than 2 million daily active users, Wooga was one of the most interesting challenges so far.

      <p>Kreuzwerker is a software consultancy based in Berlin.</p>
      <p>I was maintaining existing applications, planning out the Digital Asset Management system for AIDA cruises and some spicy rescue missions.</p>

      <h3>Flat.st</h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">07/2011</span>, <span class="role">Developer</span></div>
      <p>A short but very enjoyable gig for the web's next flatsharing platform. I participated in many discussions about user interaction and I have implemented some vanilla features on a Rails 3 application. I have also introduced RSpec acceptance tests.</p>

      <p>Previous to the 2010 EuRuKo event the Ruby User Group Berlin decided to organize and design the conference for 2011. I liked the idea to give the Ruby community something back by helping to make this event as great as possible.</p>
      <p>As a member of the organizing team I co-created the InDesign layout for the fundraising brochure and furthermore hosted the website. During the conference I also had great fun managing the Twitter communication.</p>

      <div><span class="timespan">since 06/2010</span>, <span class="role">Consultant</span></div>
      <p>I met Mathias Eylers, the founder of Palupas GmbH, at a Start-Up dinner in Berlin. I really liked his idea of customizing flip flops for the general population. His idea was to  sell them online, so with my experience I helped him accelerate thelaunch of the online platform. Since then I have been taking care of the servers.</p>

      <h3><a href="http://upstre.am">Upstream</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">08/2009</span>, <span class="role">Developer</span></div>
      <p>Additionaly to working together with Upstream on the PaperC platform, I developped features for a project of  one of their clients. Unfortunately this project is no longer online, but the code and tests I wrote are still passing.</p>
    </div>

      <h3><a href="http://paperc.de">PaperC</a></h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">02/2008 - 06/2011</span>, <span class="role">Co-Founder</span>, <span class="role">Developer</span></div>
      <p>PaperC was my Start-Up company. I was one of the three founders and had the role of the CTO. Our idea was to virtualize textbooks and specialist literature and thusly making them accessible to everyone. During my time with PaperC I worked together with Upstream Berlin. In 2009 the company won the <a href="http://www.deutsche-startups.de/2009/11/30/paperc-ist-das-start-up-des-jahres/">Start-Up of the year award</a> given by deutsche-startups.de</p>
      <p>My responsibilites as CTO went from implementing features to keeping the infrastructure healthy. The team size varied a lot since we often worked  together with freelancers in our project teams. At its peak the team grew up to 6 people who worked on the platform.</p>

      <h3>lrieder.com Webdesign</h3>
      <div><span class="timespan">01/2007 - 08/2009</span>, <span class="role">Freelancer</span></div>
      <p>The project lrieder.com was my first approach to realize web projects as a freelancer. During that time I was responsible for designing, creating and hosting over 17 sites of small to mid sized companies. I am very happy about this time, because it was one of my first job experiences and because of the many great client relations I took away.</p>

      <p>My alternative civilian service was a very influencal time in my life. It was an incredible experience working with disabled children. These children seem so far away from life on first sight, but they feel, live and enjoy life as much as we do.</p>
