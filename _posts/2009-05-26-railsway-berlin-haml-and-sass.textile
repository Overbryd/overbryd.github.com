title: Railsway 09 Berlin -- HAML, SASS (and COMPASS)
---

I visited this talk in order to learn some tricks to improve my HAML usage.
My personal favourite was the importance of filters. Using filters you can write intended javascript in your views.

{% highlight ruby %}
-content_for :jquery
  :javascript
    function foo(){
      alert('Blah');
    }
{% endhighlight %}
