Monkey Patching much nicer, but watch super calls. There's also an framework/plugin called @chainable@.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Customer
  def update
    puts "do stuff"
  end
end

# crack open Customer again
class Customer
  old_update = 
  def 
end
{% endhighlight %}

@method_added@ callback lets you define class level keywords like @private@ or @protected@ to control the behaviour of the following method(s).
